# Blood Vessel Segmentation Using Attention U-Net
### Summary
 Developed a U-Net architecture with visual attention blocks for semantic segmentation of blood vessels using the DRIVE dataset, enhancing pixel-level classification accuracy.
Utilized CLAHE and Bilateral Filtering to improve image quality and applied random flip augmentation to reduce overfitting in a limited dataset.
Implemented Focal Loss to effectively address class imbalance, improving the model's ability to detect minority class pixels in the segmentation task.
